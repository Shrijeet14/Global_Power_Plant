SUMMARY:
------------------------
The file ADA_Project_Notebook_2_Model_Building_Group3.ipynb is a Python notebook that forms a crucial part of the project's codebase<br>- This notebook is primarily responsible for the model building phase of the project<br>- In the broader context of the project architecture, this file is where the data, which has been processed and prepared in other parts of the codebase, is used to train machine learning models<br>- The models are then evaluated and fine-tuned within this notebook<br>- The main purpose of this file is to provide a structured and documented environment for developing, testing, and improving the predictive models that are central to the project's objectives<br>- It allows for iterative experimentation with different models and parameters, with the goal of producing the most accurate and reliable predictions possible<br>- This file is a key component of the project's machine learning pipeline, linking the data processing stages with the prediction and evaluation stages<br>- It is instrumental in achieving the project's overall goal of creating effective machine learning models.</td>
